# OS Memory management (no paging) Simulator

A simulation of processes and how they are used and how they occupy memory frames through a Scheduler. Best-fit, worst-fit, and first-fit choices shows different fragmentation of memory

## Features

Memory can allocate frames to jobs in three different ways, and can deallocate according to a Scheduler and a tick. 
Jobs running are shown in a final snapshots that shows for each tick how many jobs are currently running and how memory is fragmented, diverse according to the logic used (best-fit, worst-fit, first-fit)
